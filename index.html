            <h2>Comparison of Semantic Elements</h2>
            <p>
                Both Agoda and Booking.com use semantic HTML elements effectively to structure their content. Agoda utilizes <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> elements to organize the site’s layout. For example, the <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> element contains the logo and main navigation links, while <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> elements are used to group related content like hotel listings and user reviews.
            </p>
            <p>
                Booking.com also employs similar semantic elements such as <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>. The use of <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> elements for individual hotel listings and <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> elements for supplementary information helps to create a clear and logical content structure.
            </p>
            <p>
                The semantic elements on both websites are appropriate for their purposes, enhancing readability and accessibility. Agoda focuses on a user-friendly booking experience with well-defined sections, while Booking.com prioritizes a streamlined search and booking process.

The use of contrast is evident in the color scheme, with bold text and vibrant images against a white background. Typography is modern and readable, contributing to an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly experience. Alignment and proximity are well-maintained, with related content grouped together effectively.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Booking.com:</strong> Booking.com’s design is functional and user-centric, focusing on ease of use. The site employs a consistent blue and white color scheme, ensuring a cohesive visual experience. Typography is clear and functional, enhancing readability. The design maintains good alignment and proximity, with clear sections for search results, filters, and booking details.
            </p>

            <h2>Performance Focus</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Agoda:</strong> Agoda is optimized for performance, with fast load times and responsive design. The site uses techniques such as lazy loading for images and efficient caching to enhance performance. However, there is room for improvement by further optimizing JavaScript and reducing the size of some media assets.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Booking.com:</strong> Booking.com is also performance-oriented, ensuring quick access to content and a smooth booking process. The use of CDNs and compressed images contributes to its performance. Further optimization could be achieved by minimizing third-party scripts and further compressing media files.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Accessibility and Validation</h2>
            <p>
                Both websites are committed to accessibility and adhere to W3C standards. Agoda uses ARIA roles and attributes to enhance accessibility for users with disabilities, ensuring that all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard and screen readers. Booking.com implements similar accessibility features, making its booking process accessible to all users.
            </p>
            <p>
                W3C validation reveals minor issues for both sites, such as occasional deprecated attributes or HTML5 validation errors. Addressing these issues would further enhance their compliance with web standards and overall accessibility.
